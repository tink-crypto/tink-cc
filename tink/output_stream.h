  //   remains valid only until some other non-const method of the stream
  //   is called or the stream is destroyed.
  // * Any data which the caller stores in this buffer will eventually be
  //   written to the output (unless BackUp() is called).

  // than you needed.  You don't want to write a bunch of garbage after the
  // end of your data, so you use BackUp() to back up.
  //
  // Preconditions:
  // * The last call to Next() must have returned status OK.
  //   If there was no Next()-call yet, or the last one failed,
  //   BackUp()-call is ignored.
  // * count must be less than or equal to the size of the last buffer
  //   returned by Next().  Non-positive count is ignored (no action on this
  //   stream), and count larger than the size of the last buffer is treated
  //   as equal to the size of the last buffer.
  // * The caller must not have written anything to the last "count" bytes
  //   of that buffer.

  //   ignored.

  //      Backup(b);

  // * The stream is not closed yet,
