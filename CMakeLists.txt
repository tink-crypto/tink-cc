# Bazel rewrites import paths so that "cc/example/foo.h" can be included as
# "tink/example/foo.h". The following lines simulate this behaviour by creating
# a symlink to cc/ called tink/, and placing it in a separate subdirectory,
# which is then specified as a global include path.
#
# It's important to create a separate directory and not just drop the link in
# CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR, since adding that to the include paths will
# make the whole contents of that directory visible to the compiled files,
# which may result in undeclared dependencies that nevertheless happen to work.
