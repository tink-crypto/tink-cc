  // * Otherwise, the returned value is the number of bytes read and "data"
  //   points to a buffer containing these bytes.
  // * Ownership of this buffer remains with the stream, and the buffer
  //   remains valid only until some other non-const method of the stream
  //   is called or the stream is destroyed.
  // * It is legal for the returned buffer to have zero size, as long as

  // This is useful when writing procedures that are only supposed to read
  // up to a certain point in the input, then return.  If Next() returns a
  // buffer that goes beyond what you wanted to read, you can use BackUp()
  // to return to the point where you intended to finish.
  //
  // Preconditions:
  // * The last call to Next() must have returned status OK.
  //   If there was no Next()-call yet, or the last one failed,
  //   BackUp()-call is ignored.
  // * count must be less than or equal to the size of the last buffer
  //   returned by Next().  Non-positive count is ignored (no action on this
  //   stream), and count larger than the size of the last buffer is treated
  //   as equal to the size of the last buffer.
  //
  // Postconditions:
  // * The last "count" bytes of the last buffer returned by Next() will be
  //   pushed back into the stream.  Subsequent calls to Next() will return
  //   the same data again before producing new data.
  // * Repeated calls to BackUp() accumulate:
  //      BackUp(a);
  //      Backup(b);
  //   is equivalent to
  //      Backup(c);
  //   with c = max(0, a) + max(0, b).

  // Preconditions:
  // * The last call to Next() ended with status in {OK, OUT_OF_RANGE}.
  //
  // Postconditions:
  // * Position equal to i means that the next call to Next() will
  //   return a data buffer starting at (i+1)st byte of the stream (if any).
  // * If the last call to Next() reached end of stream (status OUT_OF_RANGE),
  //   then returned value is the total number of bytes in the stream.
